## Problem Statement

Cybersecurity consultants face a critical challenge when analyzing sensitive client documents:

**The Challenge**: Consultants receive mixed file formats (Excel, PDFs, images, PowerPoint, text) containing sensitive client data including logos, company names, and personally identifiable information (PII). They need to:
- Extract meaningful cybersecurity insights from these documents
- Completely anonymize all client-identifying information
- Standardize the analysis process across different file formats
- Generate actionable reports without compromising client privacy

**Current Pain Points**:
- Manual redaction is time-consuming and error-prone
- No standardized process for multi-format document analysis
- Risk of accidental data exposure during analysis
- Difficulty extracting structured insights from unstructured documents

## Our Solution Approach

Smart-Redact automates the entire pipeline from sensitive document intake to anonymized insight generation:

### Core Processing Pipeline
```
File Upload → PII Detection & Removal → Content Extraction → Security Analysis → Standardized Reports
```

### Key Solution Components

**1. Multi-Format File Processing**
- Handle Excel spreadsheets, PDF documents, PowerPoint presentations, images, and text files
- Extract text content while preserving structure and context
- OCR integration for scanned documents and image-based content

**2. Intelligent PII Detection & Redaction**
- AI-powered identification of company names, logos, personal information
- Context-aware masking that preserves document structure
- Pattern-based detection for emails, phone numbers, addresses, etc.

**3. Cybersecurity Content Analysis**
- Automated extraction of IAM policy statements
- Firewall rule identification and parsing
- IDS/IPS log analysis and categorization
- Security configuration assessment

**4. Insight Generation**
- Transform raw extracted data into actionable cybersecurity insights
- Generate standardized reports using consultant templates
- Highlight security gaps, misconfigurations, and recommendations

## Technology Stack Decision

### Backend: Python + FastAPI

**Why Python?**
- **Rich AI/ML Ecosystem**: Extensive libraries for NLP (spaCy), computer vision (OpenCV), and machine learning (Transformers)
- **File Processing Libraries**: Mature tools for handling all target file formats (PyPDF2, openpyxl, python-pptx)
- **OCR Integration**: Seamless integration with Tesseract and cloud OCR services
- **Security Libraries**: Robust PII detection tools like Microsoft's Presidio

**Why FastAPI?**
- **High Performance**: Async support for concurrent file processing
- **Auto Documentation**: Built-in API documentation for team collaboration
- **Type Safety**: Python type hints improve code reliability
- **Easy Integration**: Simple REST API interface for frontend communication

### Frontend: React.js

**Why React?**
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular UI components for file upload, processing status, and results display
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive libraries for file handling (react-dropzone) and UI components
- **Team Familiarity**: Leverages existing frontend development skills
- **Real-time Updates**: Easy integration with backend for processing status updates

### Key Libraries & Tools

**AI/ML Processing**:
- `spaCy` - Named Entity Recognition for identifying people, organizations
- `presidio-analyzer` - Microsoft's enterprise-grade PII detection
- `transformers` - Hugging Face models for advanced text analysis
- `pytesseract` - OCR for extracting text from images and scanned documents

**File Processing**:
- `PyPDF2/pdfplumber` - Comprehensive PDF text and table extraction
- `openpyxl` - Excel file processing with formula and formatting support
- `python-pptx` - PowerPoint slide content extraction
- `Pillow (PIL)` - Image processing and manipulation

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core File Processing (Foundation)
